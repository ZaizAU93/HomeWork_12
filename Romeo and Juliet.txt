In the town of Verona there were two rich families, the Capulets and the Montagues. There was an old quarrel between those two families. 
One day Capulet made a great supper. At that supper Romeo saw Juliet and fell in love with her at ones.
Juliet had the same feelings. Romeo asked Juliet to marry him. She agreed, but nobody knew about their plan.
The next day Romeo and Juliet came to friar and he married them.
Some days passed and Juliet's father told her that she was to marry a young man whose name was Paris. 
Juliet didn't know what to do. But the friar helped her. He gave her medicine and told her to go home and be ready to marry Paris. 
But when she drinks that medicine she will sleep for forty — two hours.
Juliet did as the friar told her. Juliet's parents thought that she was dead and put her into the family tomb. 
When Romeo heard that Juliet was dead he bought some poison and went to the tomb of the Capulets. Paris was there and Romeo killed him.
Then Romeo kissed Juliet on the lips and drank his poison. At this moment Juliet woke up and saw that the young man was dead. 
Juliet took a dagger that was on the floor and killed herself.
